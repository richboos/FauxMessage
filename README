FauxMessage was created for usage on my server so my staff could activate a number of fake messages using easy commands.
For example, when we added a lottery plugin we were joining the lottery so that the ticket purchases which
are broadcast would help advertise the lottery.  This unfortunately resulted in the staff winning the lottery on
many occasions.  I created this plugin to solve this issue and get my feet wet with my first plugin ever!

FauxMessage has 3 components you need and you will on your way.

Configuration
The configuration uses a command=output style setup.  For example:
lottery="%player has purchased a lottery ticket"

Permissions
The permission nodes relate to the command in the configuration.
In the above example the following permission would allow the lottery command
fauxmessage.lottery
I have also implemented node for allowing all commands
fauxmessage.*

Commands
Use commands after /fauxmessage or /fm
/fm lottery
