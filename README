FauxMessage was created for usage on my server so the staff could activate a number of fake messages using easy commands.
For example, when we first added a lottery plugin, we were joining the lottery so that the ticket purchases which
are broadcast upon completion would help advertise the lottery.  This unfortunately resulted in the staff winning the lottery on
many occasions which was not the intent.  I created this plugin to solve this issue and get my feet wet with my first plugin ever!

Another way to describe the plugin is that it removes the conversation-formatting of the in-game chat.

FauxMessage has 3 components you need to review and then you will be on your way.

Configuration
The configuration uses a command=output style setup.  For example:
lottery="%player has purchased a lottery ticket"

Permissions
The permission nodes relate to the command in the configuration.
In the above example the following permission would allow the lottery command
fauxmessage.lottery
I have also implemented a node for allowing all commands, though currently only one exists.
fauxmessage.*

Commands
Use commands after /fauxmessage or /fm
/fm lottery
